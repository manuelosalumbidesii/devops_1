        <h1>Introduction to DevOps</h1>
        <p>DevOps is a set of practices that aims to unify software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). It is designed to enhance collaboration, increase deployment frequency, and achieve more reliable and faster software delivery through automation and continuous improvement.</p>
        
        <p>By integrating development and operations teams, organizations can reduce silos, respond more quickly to market changes, and improve overall service quality. Key components of DevOps include continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, and monitoring and logging.</p>
